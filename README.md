# qperf
A performance measurement tool for QUIC similar to iperf.
Uses https://github.com/h2o/quicly 

# basic usage and example output
```
Usage: ./qperf [options]

Options:
  -c target             run as client and connect to target server
  --cc [reno,cubic]     congestion control algorithm to use (default reno)
  -e                    measure time for connection establishment and first byte only
  -g                    enable UDP generic segmentation offload
  --iw initial-window   initial window to use (default 10)
  -l log-file           file to log tls secrets
  -p                    port to listen on/connect to (default 18080)
  -s                    run as server
  -t time (s)           run for X seconds (default 10s)
  -h                    print this help
```

*Note*: The server looks for a TLS certificate and key in the current working dir named "server.crt" and "server.key" respectively. You can use a self signed certificate; the client doesn't validate it.
